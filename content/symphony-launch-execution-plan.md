## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

**Risk:** Demo server overload
**Mitigation:** Monitor Vercel analytics, scale if needed, have fallback message ready

**Risk:** npm package installation issues
**Mitigation:** Test thoroughly pre-launch, have quick-fix PR ready, monitor npm stats

**Risk:** Security vulnerabilities reported
**Mitigation:** security@symbi.world monitored, 24hr response commitment, have patch process ready

**Risk:** Critical bugs discovered
**Mitigation:** Prioritize fixes, communicate transparently, release patch ASAP

### Community Risks

**Risk:** Negative feedback on architecture
**Mitigation:** Respond professionally, acknowledge valid critiques, plan improvements

**Risk:** Low engagement
**Mitigation:** Engage actively in comments, cross-post to related communities, reach out to specific users

**Risk:** Spam/troll comments
**Mitigation:** Moderate respectfully, focus on constructive discussions, use platform tools

### Competitive Risks

**Risk:** Comparisons to existing solutions
**Mitigation:** Clearly articulate differentiators (W3C compliance, AI-specific, production-ready)

**Risk:** "Why not use X instead?"
**Mitigation:** Prepared responses showing unique value, avoid bashing competitors
